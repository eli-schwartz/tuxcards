Installation
============

   These are generic installation instructions.
You must have qt4.x.x installed. Preferable qt4.4.3 or above.

   To compile a qt-application make sure that the variables
QTDIR, QT_LIBRARY_PATH and QMAKESPEC are set. QTDIR pointing
to the qt directory and QT_LIBRARY_PATH to the qt library path.
QMAKESPEC must be set to the platform and compiler combination
that you are using on your system. For example, if you are using
Solaris and g++, you would set this environment variable to
"solaris-g++". See your "../qt/mkspecs/" directory for a suitable
combination.
For more detailed instructions see the qt installation guide and
the qmake documentation.



The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `qmake tuxcards.pro' to configure the package for your system. This
     will create the 'Makefile'.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the program, the flower files and the
     documentation. It might be the case that 'make install' prints an error.
     Don't worry about it and try to start the program.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean' or 'make distclean'.



What do I do when ...

  1. the program 'qmake' is not found?


  Solution:
     After a successfull installation of qt you need to add the qt bin-directory
     to your path.
     On most systems, the qt directory is located at '/usr/local/qt' or
     '/usr/lib/qt'. If your qt dir is at '/usr/lib/qt' you have to type

     > export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt
     > export PATH=$PATH:$QTDIR/bin




  2. the make process fails with a message like this:
     > /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lqt
     > collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
     > make: *** [tuxcards] Error 1
     ?


  Solution:
     Open the Makefile with an editor and edit it by hand. Exchange
     '-lqt' with '-lqt-mt'. Save your changes and start over the compilation
     process with 'make'.
